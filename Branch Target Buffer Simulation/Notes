The good
	Report.

The bad
	btBuffer.cpp, lines 176-177 => if(!currentBTBEntry.valid){ btb[index] = SetBTBEntry(realEntry); ...
(-5)		BTB is updated only when a branch turns out to be taken. Here, it is updated when a BTB miss occurs because of an invalid line. BTB should not be updated here.
(-3)		Since an invalid line means a BTB miss, missHitCount should be incremented when an invalid BTB line is accessed.
	btBuffer.cpp, lines 195-197
(-5)		These lines should be outside of the if/else block they are in, because update process of the BTB is independent from BTB hits/misses.
